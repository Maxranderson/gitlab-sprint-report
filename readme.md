# Gitlab Sprint Report

The idea of this project is to capture all your Sprint issues, effort and what changed until the end of the Sprint.
This is going to use all features available inside the Free Gitlab version.

## To do

[ ] Capture issues from Sprint using Gitlab API
[ ] Get duration in every status
[ ] Generate a Sprint Report
[ ] CLI interface (Maybe [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra))
